Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is an essential networking protocol that automates the process of assigning IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS configurations to devices on a network. Operating at the application layer and using UDP (port 67 for servers and port 68 for clients), DHCP eliminates the need for manual IP configuration, making network management more efficient.

DHCP functions on a client-server model, where a DHCP client (device requesting an IP) communicates with a DHCP server (responsible for assigning addresses from a predefined pool). The allocation follows a four-step DORA process:

    Discover – The client sends a broadcast request for an IP.
    Offer – The server responds with an available IP from its pool.
    Request – The client accepts the offer and sends a confirmation.
    Acknowledge – The server finalizes the lease and allows the client to use the IP.

IP addresses assigned through DHCP are leased for a specific duration, requiring renewal upon expiration. While DHCP simplifies network administration, it also poses security risks, such as rogue DHCP servers, IP spoofing, and DoS attacks, which can disrupt connectivity. Implementing security measures like DHCP snooping and access control lists helps protect networks from these vulnerabilities.
