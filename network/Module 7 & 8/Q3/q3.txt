Q3.

Traceroute:

traceroute (Linux) is a network diagnostic tool used to track the path that packets take from a source device (your computer) to a destination (website or server).It helps identify network latency, routing issues, and network congestion by displaying the intermediate routers (hops) that a packet travels through.
Traceroute is a powerful tool for diagnosing network issues, but its results should be interpreted carefully, as some routers may filter or prioritize different types of traffic.
